    "Natural Language Processing corresponds to the automated study of language. To deal with texts, we have to convert them into meaningful representations that can be handled by computers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, the first step consists of cleaning the data. As you have already done it during the past weeks, we won't emphasize this part today. However, if you have finished an exercise and you feel confortable with what you have, you are welcome to improve the data cleaning to achieve better performances.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Good Practice** ✅ Never spend too much time on data cleaning! First, build the entire pipeline to have a baseline evaluation of your task. **Then, and only then, improve your data cleaning and _watch_ if it is really improving your score**. Otherwise, if you work on your data cleaning without baseline evaluation of your performances, you don't know whether your fancy data cleaning is improving the entire pipeline or not. And sometimes, it can get super counterintuitive ;)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, a large part of the data cleaning is already done. The next step is to convert each word of our vocabulary to a vector that can be fed to a Recurrent Neural Network. To do that, you will use the powerful and well-known Word2Vec algorithm.\n",

    "# The data\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras provides many datasets, among which the ÌMDB dataset: it corresponds to sentences that are movie reviews. Each of them is related to a score given by the review writer.\n",
    "\n",
    "❓ **Question** ❓ Let's first load the data. You don't have to understand what is going on in the function, it does not matter here.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **Warning** ⚠️ The `load_data` function has a `percentage_of_sentences` argument. Depending on your computer, there are chances that a too large number of sentences will make your compute slow down, or even freeze - your RAM can even overflow. For that reason, you can start with 20% of the sentences and see if your computer handles it. Otherwise, rerun with a lower number. On the other hand, you can increase the number if you feel like it.
